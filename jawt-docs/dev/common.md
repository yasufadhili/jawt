# Common Utilities (`internal/common`)

The `internal/common` package is intended to house general-purpose utility functions and data structures that are shared across multiple parts of the JAWT toolchain. Currently, this package is empty, but it serves as a designated location for future common functionalities.

## Purpose

To provide a centralized location for:

*   Helper functions that don't fit into more specific packages.
*   Shared data structures or constants.
*   Cross-cutting concerns that need to be accessed by various components.

## Future Considerations

As the JAWT toolchain evolves, common utilities such as string manipulation, file system helpers, or generic data structures might be placed here to promote code reusability and maintain a clean separation of concerns.
