# ðŸ§­ The Philosophy of Jawt

> *"Jawt is not built to be everything. It is built to be enough."*

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Declarative Above All**

Jawt is built on the principle that **you should describe what you want, not how to do it**. JML isnâ€™t about imperative logic, control flow, or nested components inside function returns â€” itâ€™s about **structure, meaning, and clarity**.

* You write what should exist.
* The compiler handles how it exists.

This is the declarative truth.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **One Way Is Enough**

In Jawt, everything has a way. One way. Maybe two if the compilerâ€™s in a good mood.

No dozens of syntax flavours. No plugin-driven ambiguity. No configuration yoga.

> *"Options are the enemy of decisions."*

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. **The Compiler Knows**

Routing? The compiler knows. Component structure? The compiler knows. File types? Imports? Store observation? The compiler knows.

You write your intent. Jawt handles the implementation.

Trust the compiler.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. **Invisible Complexity**

Jawt is complex â€” but invisibly so. The user does not see the internal Tailwind, the embedded Node, the compiler pipelines. The user sees only the interface:

* `.jml` files
* Declarative structure
* Live-updating apps

Everything else is hidden in `.jawt/`, by design.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. **Code Should Feel Like Language**

JML isnâ€™t a DSL bolted onto JavaScript. Itâ€™s a language in its own right.

* Structured like JSON, expressive like TypeScript
* Reads like UI poetry
* Feels like declaration, not configuration

You donâ€™t fight the language. You *speak* it.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. **Zero Config is Sacred**

No `vite.config.js`, no `tailwind.config.js`, no `tsconfig.json`. Not in your root directory. Not in your face.

Jawt handles all that â€” inside `.jawt/`, where it belongs.

You should never have to set up your toolchain just to say "Hello, World".

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. **Built for One**

Jawt is not meant for everyone. It is designed for a single user with strong taste â€” and maybe a few wanderers who happen to share it.

> *"Itâ€™s not a framework. Itâ€™s a belief system with a compiler."*

Jawt doesnâ€™t ask for mass adoption. It asks for alignment.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. **Simplicity is Strictness**

Simplicity isnâ€™t minimalism. Itâ€™s **non-negotiable clarity**. Jawt removes whatâ€™s optional. It eliminates edge-case rituals. It replaces guesswork with structure.

There is no freedom in ambiguity â€” only chaos.

Structure is freedom.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. **Donâ€™t Expose the Machinery**

The more a developer has to think about how the toolchain works, the more broken the toolchain is.

Users of Jawt donâ€™t see the moving parts. They only see the results:

* Declarative files
* Self-contained output
* No setup
* No clutter

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. **Every Project Is a Manifesto**

Every Jawt app is a declaration. Itâ€™s not just code â€” itâ€™s structure, flow, state, and logic distilled into something legible, meaningful, and deterministic.

> You donâ€™t just write with Jawt.
> You **state**. You **declare**. You **proclaim**.

Jawt is a declaration engine disguised as a toolchain.

And that is its power.

---

**If you believe in structure over sprawl, in declaration over duct tape, and in writing code that reads like it was meant to exist â€” then Jawt is already yours.**
