# 🔥 The Jawt Vibe

**Jawt isn’t just a toolchain. It’s a philosophy.**

It’s opinionated. Unapologetic. Uncompromising.
Built for one. Meant for none. Feared by many.

> **If React is a Swiss army knife, Jawt is a handcrafted katana wrapped in strict type safety and righteous declaration.**

---

## ✨ It feels like:

* Writing UI like you’re describing a prophecy, not assembling widgets
* Coding without drowning in configs, plugins, or build scripts
* Having your own compiler whisper, “I got this” when you hit save
* A full-stack of invisible gears moving perfectly behind your single `.jml` file
* Web Components and TypeScript doing all the heavy lifting — quietly, out of sight
* A spiritual rejection of boilerplate and ceremony

---

## 🧘‍♂️ It’s for devs who:

* Want to express ideas, not fight syntax
* Are tired of pretending `useEffect` is simple
* Believe routing should “just work” when you write a file
* Think `div` soup is a modern sin
* Build for themselves — not for StackOverflow points

---

## 🧱 The Rules:

* Everything begins with `_doctype`
* No `node_modules` shall touch the user’s soul
* One way to do things. Maybe two if you bribe the compiler
* Components are sacred, props are pure
* Logic is TypeScript, structure is JML
* If it compiles, it shall live

---

## 🛠️ TL;DR:

Jawt is a minimalist’s maximalist toolchain.
It’s structured, declarative, and deeply personal.
It doesn’t want to be popular. It wants to be **right**.

If you get it, you’re home.
If you don’t — there’s always React.
