# JAWT - Just Another Web Tool

So, what's JAWT? Honestly, it's a personal scratch to an itch. I want to build web apps without getting bogged down in a swamp of configuration files, boilerplate, and a dozen different libraries just to get a "Hello, World" on screen.

JAWT is my take on a simpler, more direct way to build things for the web. It's a toolchain built around a declarative language called **JML**. The whole idea is to let you describe *what* you want your app to look like and do, and let the tool handle the messy parts.

> **Heads up!** This is still very much a work-in-progress. Things might change, break, or not work as expected.

## What's the big idea?

Instead of a bulleted list of "features", here's what it feels like to use JAWT:

*   **Just write what you mean:** The JML syntax is designed to be clear and expressive. You lay out your UI structure in a way that makes sense.
*   **Build with blocks:** Create reusable components, pass them properties, and compose them together to build complex UIs from simple pieces.
*   **See it as you build it:** The dev server has hot-reloading, so your changes pop up in the browser instantly. I know frameworks can do this :).
*   **No heavy lifting:** It generates lightweight, optimised code without you having to configure a thing. It's zero-config out of the box.
*   **TypeScript is a first-class citizen:** When you need to add logic, you can use TypeScript.
