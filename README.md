# JAWT—Just Another Web Tool

**JAWT is a toolchain for building web applications using a declarative approach.** 

Write your application structure and behaviour using **JML**, a domain-specific language for JAWT.

>**NOTE:** Very early development

## Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Express your UI structure clearly and concisely
- **Component System**: Build reusable components with props and composition
- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Minimal Bundle**: Generates lightweight, optimised output
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for scripting UI functionality
